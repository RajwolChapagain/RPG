L:tutorial_npc_base,New comers!
,You’ve met old Doloris huh. I can tell from your despirited looks.
R:einar_base/lachlan_base,That and we lost one of our friends.
L:tutorial_npc_base,"Oh no. The beasts have claimed one of your own, huh?"
L:rachelle_base/magda_base,Beasts??
,Our friend died from falling on a sharp rock. We know of no beasts.
L:tutorial_npc_base,"Well, you will."
,"This place is teeming with them, some degenerate essence collectors, others animals who happened to ingest essences."
,"Wait, are you here to harvest essences as well?"
R:rachelle_base/magda_base,"God, no. We fell into this pit while on our way to the royal court."
,We’re mercenaries summoned by the King to deal with some threat to the kingdom in the overworld.
L:tutorial_npc_base,Poor you. You’re now trapped in a place where even your souls can’t escape.
,"But ever since you arrived, I’ve sensed something I haven’t ever from this contraption."
R:lachlan_base/einar_base,What do you sense?
L:tutorial_npc_base,Fear. The engine is frightful for the first time.
,I hear its shrieks and rumbles from deep beneath.
R:lachlan_base/einar_base,I hear nothing.
L:tutorial_npc_base,"Well, maybe you all will be the ones to fulfill the prophecy."
,"I have faith in you. Here, take this. This will help you in your endeavor."
